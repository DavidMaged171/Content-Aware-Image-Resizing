# Content-Aware-Image-Resizing
Application of shortest path algorithm.


Using Shortest path algorithms the task requires to reduce its size by removing some pixels. Each pixel has a value that indicates its importance based on its color called ENERGY. To avoid disturbing visual effects, we require to obtain the vertical seam with minimum total energy.
